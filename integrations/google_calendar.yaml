#====================
# The google calendar platform allows you to connect to your Google Calendars and
# generate binary sensors. The sensors created can trigger based on any event on the
# calendar or only for matching events. When you first setup this integration it will
# generate a new configuration file google_calendars.yaml in your configuration directory
# that will contain information about all of the calendars you can see. It also exposes a
# service to add an event to one of your Google Calendars.
